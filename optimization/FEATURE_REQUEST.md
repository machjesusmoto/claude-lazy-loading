# Feature Request: Lazy Loading for MCP Servers and Tools

## Problem Statement

Currently, Claude Code loads all configured MCP servers, tools, and agents at session startup, consuming significant context before any conversation begins. In my environment:

- **MCP tools**: 39.8k tokens (19.9%)
- **Custom agents**: 9.7k tokens (4.9%) 
- **System tools**: 22.6k tokens (11.3%)
- **Memory files**: 36.0k tokens (18.0%)
- **Total**: ~108k tokens (54% of 200k limit)

This leaves only 92k tokens for actual conversation and work, severely limiting complex tasks.

## Proposed Solution

Implement lazy loading for MCP servers and tools, loading them only when needed based on conversation context.

### Core Features

1. **Lightweight Registry System**
   - Load only a small index (~5k tokens) at startup
   - Registry contains tool names, descriptions, and trigger keywords
   - Tools load on-demand when keywords are detected

2. **Intelligent Loading**
   - Analyze user input for relevant keywords
   - Load only required tools for the task
   - Cache loaded tools for session duration
   - Preload related tools that commonly work together

3. **Configuration Options**
   ```json
   {
     "optimization": {
       "lazyLoading": true,
       "maxInitialTokens": 5000,
       "autoLoadThreshold": 0.8,
       "cacheMinutes": 30
     },
     "mcpServers": {
       "example-server": {
         "command": "...",
         "lazyLoad": true,
         "triggers": ["keyword1", "keyword2"],
         "preloadWith": ["related-server"]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

## Benefits

- **95% Token Reduction**: From 108k to ~5k initial tokens
- **Longer Conversations**: 195k tokens available vs 92k currently
- **Better Performance**: Faster startup, lower memory usage
- **Scalability**: Can add more tools without context penalty

## Implementation Suggestion

### Phase 1: Basic Lazy Loading
- Add `lazyLoad` flag to MCP server configs
- Load registry instead of full tool definitions
- Implement on-demand loading when tool is called

### Phase 2: Intelligent Preloading
- Keyword-based auto-loading
- Pattern recognition for common workflows
- Tool relationship mapping

### Phase 3: Advanced Optimization
- Session-based learning of tool usage patterns
- Predictive preloading based on project context
- Dynamic unloading of unused tools

## User Experience

### Before (Current)
```
Starting session...
Loading 73 MCP tools... [39.8k tokens]
Loading 56 agents... [9.7k tokens]
Loading system tools... [22.6k tokens]
Ready with 92k tokens remaining.
```

### After (With Lazy Loading)
```
Starting session...
Loading tool registry... [5k tokens]
Ready with 195k tokens available.

```

## Test Case

I've already built a proof-of-concept in `~/.claude/optimization/` that demonstrates:
- Registry generation from existing MCP configs
- Keyword extraction and mapping
- Lazy loader with pattern matching
- 95% token reduction achieved

Files available for reference:
- `tool-registry.json` - Example registry structure
- `lazy-loader.py` - Proof of concept implementation
- `generate-index.py` - Registry generation logic

## Priority

**High** - This is a critical limitation for power users with many tools and complex workflows. The current 54% context consumption at startup makes many advanced use cases impossible.

## Similar Products

- **VSCode**: Lazy loads extensions based on file types and activation events
- **JetBrains IDEs**: Load plugins on-demand based on project type
- **Vim/Neovim**: Lazy loading plugins (lazy.nvim, vim-plug with lazy loading)

Happy to provide more details, test beta implementations, or share the proof-of-concept code.
